# Building Blocks

This journal is meant to document the creation of an isometric urban game!


## 8/11/2025 (7.5 hours) 

Summary of today: I spent today learning the fundamentals of godot and started the illustrations for the ground of my world and the sketch of my main chrachter!

### (3PM -> 4PM) 1 hour

Watched and tried following tutorial: https://youtu.be/LOhfqjmasi0?feature=shared

so this is difficult, and did not show how to use the isometric pattern... time to see how to learn that!


### (4PM -> 7:30PM) 3.5 hours

So I found this nifty tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLldN3KX0dI and they said to design sprites first. Onto procreate!


sample ground block I created:

Was creating assets but then my ipad crashed and lost all my work... so i restarted :D

Here's everything uploaded to godot!

### (10 pm -> 1AM) 3 hours

Spent time creating the main charachter! Went through some revisions:

- first I wanted to do a UFO like setup which looked clunky and pretty unoriginal
- then I fiddled around with some robot sketches, but felt that it was also a bit boring
- I finally setted on a cat (inspired by my cat!) on a caterpillar track

  ## 8/12/2025  6 hours

  I worked on some more tileart! I think I have developed the neon-future color theme I want for this game

  ### (4PM -> 8PM) 4 hours

  So the game window on godot isn't showing anythign so I am debugging... this might take a minute
