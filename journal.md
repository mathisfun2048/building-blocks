### 3PM -> <present>

Am working on learning how to use godot! 

(3PM -> 4PM) 

Watched and tried following tutorial: https://youtu.be/LOhfqjmasi0?feature=shared

so this is difficult, and did not show how to use the isometric pattern... time to see how to learn that!


(4PM -> 7:30PM)

So I found this nifty tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLldN3KX0dI and they said to design sprites first. Onto procreate!


sample ground block I created:

Was creating assets but then my ipad crashed and lost all my work... so i restarted :D

Here's everything uploaded to godot!
