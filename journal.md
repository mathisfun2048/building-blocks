# Building Blocks

This journal is meant to document the creation of an isometric urban game!


## 8/11/2025 (7.5 hours) 

Summary of today: I spent today learning the fundamentals of godot and started the illustrations for the ground of my world and the sketch of my main chrachter!

### (3PM -> 4PM) 1 hour

Watched and tried following tutorial: https://youtu.be/LOhfqjmasi0?feature=shared

so this is difficult, and did not show how to use the isometric pattern... time to see how to learn that!


### (4PM -> 7:30PM) 3.5 hours

So I found this nifty tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLldN3KX0dI and they said to design sprites first. Onto procreate!


sample ground block I created:

Was creating assets but then my ipad crashed and lost all my work... so i restarted :D

Here's everything uploaded to godot!

### (10 pm -> 1AM) 3 hours

Spent time creating the main charachter! Went through some revisions:

- first I wanted to do a UFO like setup which looked clunky and pretty unoriginal
- then I fiddled around with some robot sketches, but felt that it was also a bit boring
- I finally setted on a cat (inspired by my cat!) on a caterpillar track

  ## 8/12/2025  (6 hours)

  ### (3pm -> 4pm) 1 Hour

  ### (4PM -> 8PM) 4 hours

  So the game window on godot isn't showing anythign so I am debugging... this might take a minute

  <img width="1137" height="715" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c764a79-635f-4252-80ca-7ba13b5f05f5" />

### (8pm -> 9pm) 1 hour 

looked into the workings of TileMapLayer objects and how to implement them 

also found a way to automate thr placing of boundaries 

## 8/13/2025 (6 hours)

### 1PM -> 2PM (1 hour)

### 2PM -> 4PM (2 hours)

Spent some time messign around with the controls and layout and feel I've got a prototype that I like. 

It's inspired by minecraft's end cities!

4:40 -- update: I couldn't get github pages to work so I am going to try itch.io

### 5pm -> 7pm (2 hours) 

I am going to try to get the portal setup that will allow my charachters to go into the respective buildings!

6pm update: I got portals to work! Now all I have to od is make them lead somewhere!

## 8/15/2025

## 1PM -> <present>

Lets finish this game!!

I really want to explore what I can do with the portals and am going to make a teleporting maze! The user will need to navigate throuhg different buildings to eventually get to the end! The user will know they ended when they return to the home island. The user is free to choose through whihc one of the gates to go through--they're all open and interlinked >:)

Update: 3PM --> winging the portals took a bit too much time... I am now making a graph on my ipad to verify that the path spread is even

Update: 4:17PM -> there were problems so I re-did the graph! Here is the visiualization! (dont cheat)
